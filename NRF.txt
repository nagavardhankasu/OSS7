NORMALIZATION 
------------------------------------
Normalization is the process of splitting a large table into smaller table where 
ever possible 

1st Normalization Form
		each cell should contain only a single value 
2nd Normalization Form
		must be 1st NF
		Each record must be identified uniquely , 
		all the other columns have dependency with indentity key column 
 
3rd Normalization Form 
		should be 2nd NF
		No transitive Dependencies . if transitive depnedency , Split 				the table and create a new table to avoid TD
